	"WALKING"
	"WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
	"WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"
	"SITTING"
	"STANDING"
	"LAYING"
 
All the following variables are numeric, the ones indicated with X-Y-Z mean that there is one variable/values per axis.
Every value present in the tidy data set is a mean of all measures for 1 given activity for 1 given subject:
